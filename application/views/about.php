                                <p>
                                    Cairo Film School is an Educational Foundation concerned about teaching filmmakers
                                    how to get the best out of the modern production tools to make professional low
                                    budget movies.

                                <p>
                                    We exist, because the future of cinema is so bright. For the very first time in the
                                    history of movie indusrty, movies can run on low-budget which was unheard
                                    before,.Extremelylow budget movies have always been an exception rather than a rule.
                                    Now, it’s the reverse. You can get beautiful images with affordable cameras. You can
                                    record sound. You can edit and mix and color-correct at home. This is the present of
                                    filmmaking as well as its future !

                                <p>
                                    with all the attention paid to the machinery of making movies and to the advancment
                                    in technology that have led to this revolution in filmmaking, there is one important
                                    thing to remember: the tools don’t make the movie, you make the movie. that’s why we
                                    hope to make a bridge between independent filmmakers and industry professionals
                                    which encourage our students to make low-budget high-quality movies.
